Neil C. MacLachlan is a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and Rackham Merit Fellow pursuing a PhD in Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics at the University of Michigan. His research lies at the intersection of computational neuroscience and applied mathematics, focusing on large-scale brain simulations, mathematical modeling of electrophysiology, and the development of data-driven algorithms for understanding neural systems.

Neil is committed to making mathematics more accessible and engaging. As a cofounder and Editor-in-Chief of the Pittsburgh Interdisciplinary Mathematics Review, he spearheaded efforts to create an inclusive platform for exploring the interplay between mathematics and other disciplines. The journal, now archived by the Library of Congress, reflects his dedication to fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

Beyond his research and editorial leadership, Neil is passionate about science communication and teaching. His work embodies a drive to blend rigorous mathematics with real-world applications, bridging diverse fields to address complex scientific challenges.

A data-driven personal website
======


Getting started
======

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
