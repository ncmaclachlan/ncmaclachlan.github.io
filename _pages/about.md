Neil C. MacLachlan is a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and Rackham Merit Fellow pursuing a PhD in Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics at the University of Michigan. His research lies at the intersection of computational neuroscience and applied mathematics, focusing on large-scale brain simulations, mathematical modeling of electrophysiology, and the development of data-driven algorithms for understanding neural systems.

Neil is committed to making mathematics more accessible and engaging. As a cofounder and Editor-in-Chief of the [Pittsburgh Interdisciplinary Mathematics Review](https://pimr.pitt.edu/pimr), he spearheaded efforts to create an inclusive platform for exploring the interplay between mathematics and other disciplines. The journal, now archived by the Library of Congress, reflects his dedication to fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

Beyond his research and editorial leadership, Neil is passionate about science communication and teaching. His work embodies a drive to blend rigorous mathematics with real-world applications, bridging diverse fields to address complex scientific challenges.
